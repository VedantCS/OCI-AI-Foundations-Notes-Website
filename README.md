## ✨ Why This Project Matters
* **Unique Value** – Most note repos are raw text; this is a complete website with tabs, accordions, cards, and tables that make complex AI topics easy to browse.  
* **Professional Design** – Clean Bootstrap 5 UI, dark sidebar, mobile-first layout, and a one-click download option for offline study.  
* **Real-world DevOps** – Deployed via GitHub Pages and automated with GitHub Actions CI/CD, so every commit instantly goes live.
